## Introduction

Natours Final is a fictional tour booking website developed as the final project for the Natours course. It showcases proficiency in backend development with Node.js and Express, as well as database management with MongoDB. The website allows users to browse through different tours, book them, manage their bookings, and explore various features provided by the platform.

## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization

The application provides robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to user data and features. Key features include:

- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) before being stored in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, user passwords remain protected.
  
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used for user authentication. Upon successful login, a JWT containing user information and permissions is generated and sent to the client. Subsequent requests to protected routes require the inclusion of this JWT in the request headers for authentication.
  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The application implements RBAC to control access to different features based on user roles. For example, regular users may have access to booking tours and managing their profile, while administrators have additional privileges such as managing tours and user accounts.

- **Middleware**: Express middleware functions are used to enforce authentication and authorization for protected routes. These middleware functions intercept incoming requests, verify the authenticity of JWTs, and grant or deny access based on user roles and permissions.

### Data Validation and Sanitization

Data validation and sanitization are essential for preventing security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and ensuring the integrity of user input. Key features include:

- **Input Validation**: Incoming requests are validated against predefined schemas using libraries like Joi. This ensures that data meets specified criteria (e.g., required fields, data types) before being processed further.

- **Sanitization**: User input is sanitized to remove potentially malicious content (e.g., HTML tags, script injections) that could compromise the security of the application. Libraries like express-validator are used to sanitize input and prevent common security vulnerabilities.

### Protection against Common Attacks

Natours Final incorporates measures to protect against common web application security threats, including:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**: XSS attacks are prevented by properly encoding user input and sanitizing output to prevent the execution of malicious scripts in the browser.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**: CSRF attacks are mitigated by using techniques such as CSRF tokens and same-site cookie attributes to validate the origin of incoming requests and prevent unauthorized actions.

- **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute-force attacks and other forms of abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specified time period.

### Secure Communication

Secure communication between clients and the server is ensured through:

- **HTTPS**: The application is served over HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Technologies

Natours Final leverages a variety of technologies to deliver its features:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development, used to build the backend logic of the application.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store application data, offering flexibility and scalability.
- **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used for user authentication.
- **bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords securely before storing them in the database.
- **Helmet**: A middleware for Express.js that helps secure HTTP headers and provides protection against common web vulnerabilities.
- **express-validator**: A set of express.js middlewares for data validation and sanitization.
- **Rate Limiter**: A middleware for Express.js that provides rate limiting functionality to prevent abuse of APIs.

## Backend Design Pattern

Natours Final follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for organizing the backend codebase. This architectural pattern divides an application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the application's data structure. In Natours Final, models define the schema and interact with the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- **View**: Presents the data to the user and handles user interactions. In Natours Final, views are generated using the Pug template engine and served to the client.
- **Controller**: Manages the flow of data and logic between the model and the view. Controllers handle incoming requests, process data, and send responses back to the client. In Natours Final, controllers are implemented using Express.js.

The MVC pattern promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

## RESTful API Design

Natours Final follows RESTful principles when designing its API. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building networked applications, emphasizing a stateless client-server interaction and resource-based URLs.

In Natours Final, each entity (e.g., tours, users) is modeled as a resource with its own URL. HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these resources. Responses are returned in JSON format, providing a lightweight and flexible means of data interchange.

Adhering to RESTful principles ensures a standardized and predictable API design, making it easier to understand, maintain, and integrate with other systems.

## Security

Natours Final prioritizes security throughout the development process, implementing best practices and industry-standard techniques to protect against common vulnerabilities and threats. Key security measures include:

- **Regular Security Audits**: The codebase is regularly audited for security vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual code reviews. Vulnerabilities are promptly identified and addressed to maintain the integrity of the application.

- **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Content-Type-Options) are configured to provide an additional layer of defense against various attacks, such as XSS and clickjacking.

- **Dependency Monitoring**: Dependencies are regularly monitored for security vulnerabilities using tools like npm audit. Vulnerable dependencies are updated or replaced with secure alternatives to mitigate potential risks.

- **User Input Validation**: All user input is thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and other forms of malicious input.

- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Sensitive data, such as passwords and authentication tokens, is securely stored using industry-standard encryption algorithms to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Continuous Security Training**: Developers receive regular training and updates on emerging security threats and best practices to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain a secure application.

## Query Functionality

Natours Final provides comprehensive query functionality to allow users to retrieve and manipulate data according to their preferences. Key features include:

- **Aggregation**: MongoDB's aggregation framework is utilized to perform complex data aggregation operations such as grouping, filtering, and transforming data. This allows users to obtain aggregated results based on various criteria, such as tour duration, difficulty level, and average rating.

- **Population**: Mongoose's population feature is used to automatically populate fields in query results, enabling users to retrieve related data from referenced documents in other collections. For example, when querying tours, related data such as tour guides and user reviews can be automatically populated for a more comprehensive view of the data.

- **Sorting**: Query results can be sorted based on one or more fields in ascending or descending order. This allows users to organize data according to their preferences, such as sorting tours by price, duration, or average rating.

- **Search by Field**: Users can search for data based on specific fields using MongoDB's query operators. For example, users can search for tours by name, location, or any other relevant criteria to find tours that match their preferences.

- **Data Analysis Endpoints**: Natours Final includes endpoints for performing data analysis and generating insights from the available data. These endpoints can be used to retrieve statistics, trends, and other valuable information about tours and user activities. For example, users can query for the top 5 cheapest tours, tour statistics based on various criteria, and more.
