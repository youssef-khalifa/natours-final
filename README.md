## Introduction

Natours Final is a fictional tour booking website developed as the final project for the Natours course. It showcases proficiency in backend development with Node.js and Express, as well as database management with MongoDB. The website allows users to browse through different tours, book them, manage their bookings, and explore various features provided by the platform.

## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization

The application provides a secure authentication system where users can create accounts, log in, and access features based on their role (user or admin). Passwords are hashed and stored securely in the database.

### Tour Browsing and Booking

Users can browse through a variety of tours available on the platform. Each tour is presented with detailed information including its name, duration, price, difficulty level, and a brief description. Users can book tours by providing necessary information such as the number of participants and any additional preferences.

### Payment Integration

Seamless payment processing is facilitated through integration with the Stripe platform. Users can make payments securely using credit/debit cards, ensuring a smooth booking experience.

### User Profile Management

Registered users have access to a personalized profile where they can manage their information. This includes updating personal details such as name, email address, and profile picture. Users can also view their booking history, edit preferences, and change passwords.

### Review and Rating System

Users can share their experiences by leaving reviews and ratings for tours they have participated in. These reviews help other users make informed decisions when browsing tours. The rating system provides valuable feedback to tour operators, enabling them to improve their services.

### Admin Dashboard

Administrators have exclusive access to a comprehensive dashboard that provides powerful tools for managing the platform. From the dashboard, admins can add new tours, edit existing ones, manage user accounts, view booking details, and respond to user reviews. The admin dashboard streamlines administrative tasks, ensuring efficient management of the platform.

### Responsive Design

The application features a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and devices. Whether accessed from a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone, users can enjoy a consistent and user-friendly experience. The responsive design enhances accessibility and usability, catering to a diverse range of users.

## Technologies

Natours Final leverages a variety of technologies to deliver its features:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development, used to build the backend logic of the application.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store application data, offering flexibility and scalability.
- **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used for user authentication.
- **Stripe**: A payment processing platform used to handle secure payments within the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend technologies used for building user interfaces and styling web pages.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for client-side interactivity and logic.
- **Pug**: A template engine used for generating HTML markup with simplified syntax.
- **Git**: A version control system used for tracking changes in the codebase and collaborating with others.

## Backend Design Pattern

Natours Final follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for organizing the backend codebase. This architectural pattern divides an application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the application's data structure. In Natours Final, models define the schema and interact with the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- **View**: Presents the data to the user and handles user interactions. In Natours Final, views are generated using the Pug template engine and served to the client.
- **Controller**: Manages the flow of data and logic between the model and the view. Controllers handle incoming requests, process data, and send responses back to the client. In Natours Final, controllers are implemented using Express.js.

The MVC pattern promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

## RESTful API Design

Natours Final follows RESTful principles when designing its API. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building networked applications, emphasizing a stateless client-server interaction and resource-based URLs.

In Natours Final, each entity (e.g., tours, users) is modeled as a resource with its own URL. HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these resources. Responses are returned in JSON format, providing a lightweight and flexible means of data interchange.

Adhering to RESTful principles ensures a standardized and predictable API design, making it easier to understand, maintain, and integrate with other systems.

## Usage

Natours Final can be used in the following ways:

- **As a User**:
  - Navigate to the website and browse through available tours.
  - Create an account or log in if you already have one.
  - Book tours, manage bookings, and leave reviews for tours you have experienced.
  - Explore your profile to manage your information and preferences.

- **As an Administrator**:
  - Log in to access the admin dashboard.
  - Manage tours by adding new ones, editing existing ones, or deleting them if necessary.
  - Manage user accounts, view booking details, and respond to user reviews.
